title: example-traefik-multitenant-ssl
description: A repository that provides an example of serving multi tenant services such as pgAdmin and Traefik dashboards over HTTPS/SSL using Traefik. As of writing as far as I know, there are no existing examples covering pgadmin over Traefik SSL/HTTPS and few currently working that cover SSL/HTTPS using Traefik.
