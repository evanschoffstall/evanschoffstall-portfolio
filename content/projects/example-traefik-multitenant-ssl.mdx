description: |
    This repository offers a practical example of deploying multi-tenant services like pgAdmin and Traefik dashboards through SSL using Traefik. 
    To the best of my knowledge, at the time of writing, there are no existing examples specifically addressing pgAdmin integration with Traefik over SSL, 
    and only a limited number of examples exist that demonstrate the use of SSL with Traefik.
