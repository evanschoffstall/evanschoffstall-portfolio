description: Librerss is a pioneering, donation-supported cloud RSS feed service in its early access phase. Librerss revives the tradition of secure, free, and efficient news aggregation, reminiscent of the free regrettably defunct services provided two decades ago, and newly with modern, advanced security and cloud native infrastructure.

The foundation of this service is a cloud-native infrastructure developed using Docker Compose, featuring a FreshRSS instance for streamlined news aggregation and Traefik for specialized routing.

A commitment to security is demonstrated through the adoption of full SSL/TSL encryption, Cloudflare HTTPS, HSTS, and DNSSEC. The backend is anchored by a Postgres SQL database, managed effectively with Pgadmin, and web security is fortified with Apache and ModSecurity CRS.

This approach combines a nod to the nostalgic appeal of past RSS feeds with the advancements of current technology, aiming to offer a secure, efficient, and user-friendly RSS feed service.
