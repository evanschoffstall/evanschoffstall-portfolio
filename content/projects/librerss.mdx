description: Librerss is a pioneering, donation-supported cloud RSS feed service in its early access phase. Librerss revives the tradition of secure, free, and efficient news aggregation, reminiscent of the free regrettably defunct services provided two decades ago, and newly with modern, advanced security and cloud native infrastructure.

We've built a cloud-native infrastructure using Docker Compose, incorporating a FreshRSS instance for smooth news aggregation and Traefik for efficient routing. To ensure the security of our users' data, we've implemented SSL/TSL encryption, Cloudflare HTTPS, HSTS, and DNSSEC. Our backend is powered by a Postgres SQL database, with Pgadmin for easy management, and we've boosted our web security with Apache and ModSecurity CRS. We're proud to offer a secure, efficient, and user-friendly RSS feed service that nods to the past while embracing the future's technologies.
