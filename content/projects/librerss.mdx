Librerss revives the tradition of secure, free, and efficient news aggregation, reminiscent of the free regrettably defunct services provided two decades ago, and newly with modern, advanced security and cloud native infrastructure.

The foundation of this service is a cloud-native, scalable infrastructure developed using Docker Compose, featuring a fortified ModSecurity CRS FreshRSS instance for streamlined news aggregation and cloud-native routing using Traefik.

Commitment to security with full SSL/TSL encryption, Cloudflare HTTPS, HSTS, and DNSSEC. The backend is anchored by a Postgres SQL database, managed with Pgadmin.

This approach combines a nod to the practical, ever-relevant appeal of past RSS feeds with the advancements of current technology, aiming to offer a secure, efficient, and user-friendly RSS feed service.
